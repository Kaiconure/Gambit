# Gambit

## Overview

Gambit is an addon that allows you to define data-driven, customizable, scripted action sequences for use in FFXI.

The documentation is broken down into several categories:

- [An introduction to actions](./docs/actions.md) - An overview of the basic action structure; how they are defined, how they are triggered, and how they are configured.
- Lua interface
  - [Action properties](./docs/properties.md) - An overview of the properties available for use in your action conditions and commands.
  - [Action functions](./docs/functions.md) - An overview of the functions available for use in your action conditions and commands.
